# AHP---Easy-but-Reliable

The Primary goal is to **Predict House prices** based on various features of the properties such as **size, location and condition**
Why this project since everyone is doing house price prediction and it is very easy, **What difference will I Offer?**

**Let's get Started**

1. The pipeline is developed using **ZenML**, which is a MLOps framework helps in managing machine learning workflows, and **MLFlow** for experiment tracking and model deployment.
2. It is not a dummy project but **A Real World Deployment Framework**.
3. **More Robust** in real world scenarios .

**BUT HOW?**
1. I have done **Thorough data research** and did not just call **.fit** on model withouth thoroghly understanding data
2. I ensured **Structured data processing** and implement findings from EDA in preprocessing, and feature engineering to maximize model's performance
3. I dont just trained the model just for sake of putting it on resume on something else, but ensures it meets all neccessary **assumption and refine it iteratively.**
4. I integrated MLOps pratices uusing **ZenML and MLFlow, Implemented CI?CD Pipelines to automate testing, deployment, of the model in production**.
5. Ensure the model is not only accurate but also **maintainable, scalable and ready fo real world use**.
